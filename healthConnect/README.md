**A robust, TypeScript-based React Native Expo app demonstrating seamless integration with Google Health Connect using `react-native-health-connect`.**

This repository provides a complete guide and codebase for integrating Google Health Connect into a React Native Expo app. Fetch health data like steps, calories burned, heart rate, and sleep with ease, while handling permissions, errors, and best practices. Built with TypeScript for type safety, this project is perfect for developers building fitness or wellness apps in 2025! 🎉
